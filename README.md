# NBA-PER-Calculator

## Description
The purpose of this project is to parse through the ["balldontlie" API] and calculate the player efficiency rating using an equation from [Rusty Larue]. Player Efficiency Rating or PER is an advanced statistic that directly measures the impact that the player has on the game with the amount of minutes they get. Using advanced statistic can oftentimes settle debates about which player is superior to another. This API does not contain PER and combining the vast amount of information they have combined with the calculations in this projects the result is a very simple way to determine how good a player really is.

## Install
You will need python3 to run this program. You also need to install matplotlib. This can be installed by running pip3 install matplotlib There is no key necessary to run this program.

## Run
The file calculation.py will model the PER of Kobe Bryant through his career and provide a graph using the pyplot module of matplotlib.

## Test
You can test the program by editing the test_project.py file.
